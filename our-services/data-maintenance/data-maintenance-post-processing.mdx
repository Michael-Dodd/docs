## Returned data transfer
Data is provided to Loqate either via a managed SFTP or via the Account portal upload button (in essence a SFTP).

Data is returned via a managed SFTP only.

In the case where the data was submitted via the account section then a managed SFTP will be created for the return of data. To set up a managed SFTP, Loqate requires the name, email address and phone number of the individual who will be accessing the SFTP.

The standard is to return the data in the same format that it was sent. For example, if the data provided to Loqate was in CSV format, then it will returned this way.

## Flexibility of Returned data
It is important that the data returned is in the format and layout that makes ingestion and action as easy as possible.

Therefore, Loqate can

- Return the data in the file format of your choosing (e.g. pipe-delimited)
- Return the variables in the order you specify (e.g postcode, add1, add2, town) although as standard we return the input variables unchanged, and add additional columns to the right of the file
- Rename the column headers as required (e.g. add1 as opposed to GBG Address 1)
- Alter the contents (e.g. replace a Y or null value, with a yes or no)

## Data Maintenance HealthCheck report
Typically, the first output produced is the HealthCheck data quality report that will highlight the quality of the data against the industry-leading correction, suppression and enhancement files GBG possess.

This report is in PDF format and can be emailed.

## Variables Returned by Loqate
Depending upon the services chosen, the output will consist of one or multiple of the below.

As noted earlier, the additional columns will be provided to the right of the input fields supplied for processing. These input fields will remain untouched, thus allowing you to compare your inputs to the outputs.
