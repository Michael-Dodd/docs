A Store Finder tool works by allowing you to combine precise location information for your organisation's stores and a customer's location, then determine the relationship between the two sets of information, and present the results in a visual fashion.

  <Tab title="Overview">
Store Finder consists of eight API endpoints which you can use in conjunction to build the service that's right for your business needs:

- **Four Location Management APIs:**
  - **Create List:** creates a list of locations that can be used with the Distance Finder endpoint.
  - **Delete List or Point:** deletes a list of locations or a particular location within that list.
  - **Update List or Point:** updates a list of locations or a particular location within that list.
  - **Get List:** gets a list of locations to see the details of that list and the locations within it. 
- **Geocoding Typeahead:** uses a text search to suggest Town, City, State and Postcode/ZIP Codes. When one of these is selected by the end user, a subsequent request (using the associated address ID) can be made to retrieve the latitude and longitude for the location.
- **Global Geocoding:** takes an input of one or more address strings and returns latitude and longitudes for the given locations.
- **Global Distance Finder:** takes an input of an origin location and one or more destination locations, and returns road-based distance and travel times for each of them.
- **Mapping:** takes an input of your Loqate key and returns a Signed URL that will allow you to visually represent the output from the Distance Finder API on a map.
