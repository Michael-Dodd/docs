All of our services require API keys in order to work, which you can create in [your account](https://account.loqate.com/) - see the [Creating API Keys page](/loqate-basics/creating-api-keys) for full details of how to do this. 

In this article we'll quickly explain the specifics of creating API keys for use with a Store Finder.

## Store Finder API keys
You need to create a dedicated service for your Store Finder. On the Add service page you'll see a **Store Finder** option - click on this to get started.

This will then create two keys for you:

- A **Service** key, which should be used for all of the public-facing aspects of a Store Finder such as your calls to our Geocoding, Distance Finder and Mapping APIs
- A **Management** key, which should be kept private and only used to access our Location Management APIs for creating, editing and deleting your lists

Here's an example of how those keys will look:

You can now edit the settings for your keys (such as name, daily limit and security restrictions), or just get started with adding a Store Finder to your site.

Before you get coding, you will want to add a list of Locations that you can use. You can do this either [in your account](/our-services/store-finder/creating-and-managing-location-lists) or via our [Create List API](/api-reference/store-finder/location-management-create-list).
